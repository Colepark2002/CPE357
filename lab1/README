4.  char* cp;
    char** ap;
    int** pp;

    char c;
    char x[10];
    int* d; 
    cp = &c;
    ap = &x;
    pp = &d;

5. You could theoretically point a pointer to itself like this.
    
    void* p = &p; 

6. The fundamental problem with the code lies in the for loop
    
    for(p = s; p != '\0'; p++)
    
    should instead use *p took look at the character p is pointing at to 
    see it is the null terminator. 

    so for(p = s; *p != '\0': p++)

7. A better statement would be that array act as pointers. The fundamental
difference between arrays and pointers is that the value that the array points
at cannot be changed. where as a pointer may change the address points to. 
An array points to the first element and may be incremented further but the
starting position cannot change.
